\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\ifdefined\showacknowledgements

In the course of my studies I have been supported by more people than can be listed.

David Manlove has been an outstanding supervisor. I have benefited enormously from his superlative knowledge of algorithmics and his meticulous (latterly virtual) blue pen. Most importantly however, he has been a constant source of enthusiasm and encouragement.

Many thanks to my two examiners, Martin Gairing and Ciaran McCreesh, for taking the time to read my thesis in full and for their helpful and constructive feedback.

I am very grateful to the EPSRC for funding my degree, and to the Graduate School and the School of Computing Science for providing other funding, training, and administrative support.

I am thankful to my collaborator \'Agnes Cseh for working with me. Our meetings and correspondence have been both enjoyable and hugely valuable. Thanks also to my office-mate Peace Ayegba, who kindly read through my thesis draft and made suggestions to improve its style.

Thanks to each and every one of my other office-mates, fellow PhD students, colleagues, and other friends in the School of Computing. I hope your time at Glasgow will be (or has been!) as fun as mine.

Thank you also to my family and friends outside work, for all their encouragement and moral support. 

Finally, a special thank you to my partner Ailsa for her unwavering support ---\ackfont{Qapla'!}
