To recap, we considered the problem of finding a maximum-cardinality $K_r$-packing in an undirected graph of fixed maximum degree $\Delta$, subject to the set of selected $K_r$s being either vertex disjoint (\vdkr) or edge disjoint (\edkr). It is known that \vdkthree is solvable in linear time if $\Delta=3$ but $\APX$-hard if $\Delta \geq 4$, and \edkthree is solvable in linear time if $\Delta=4$ but $\APX$-hard if $\Delta \geq 5$ \cite{caprara_packing_2002}. We generalised these results and presented a full complexity classification for both \vdkr and \edkr. 
We first showed that \vdkr is solvable in linear time if $\Delta < 3r/2 - 1$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:krpacking_vdkr_3r2minus1}), solvable in polynomial time if $\Delta < 5r/3 - 1$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:krpacking_vdkr_polytime_5r3minus1}), and $\APX$-hard if $\Delta \geq \lceil 5r/3 \rceil - 1$ (Theorem~\ref{thm:krpacking_vdkr_apxhard}). 

We also showed that if $r\geq 6$ then \edkr is also solvable in linear time if $\Delta < 3r/2 - 1$, solvable in polynomial time if  $\Delta < 5r/3 - 1$, and $\APX$-hard if $\Delta \geq \lceil 5r/3 \rceil - 1$. If $r \leq 5$, then \edkr is solvable in linear time if $\Delta < 3r/2 - 1$, solvable in polynomial time if $\Delta \leq 2r - 2$, and $\APX$-hard if $\Delta > 2r - 2$.

Some of our polynomial-time algorithms involved finding a maximum independent set in a corresponding intersection graph. In each case, we showed that this intersection graph was claw-free, from which it follows that a maximum independent set in the intersection graph can be found in polynomial time \cite{MINTY1980284,SBIHI198053}. As we noted in 
Section~\ref{sec:krpacking_vdkr_polytimesolvability}, in a more general setting in which graph vertices have weights, it is possible to find an independent set of maximum weight \cite{MINTY1980284,Nakamura01}. It might be interesting to use this result to derive polynomial-time algorithms for weighted versions of \vdkr and \edkr.

Another direction for future work is to generalise other known results for \vdkthree and \edkthree to \vdkr and \edkr where $r \geq 3$. For example, Mani\'c and Wakabayashi \cite{Eurocomb05} showed that the known approximation ratio of $(3/2 + \varepsilon)$ for \vdkthree and \edkthree with can be improved upon in the restricted settings where $\Delta = 4$ and $\Delta = 5$, respectively. It might be possible to show a similar improvement of the corresponding approximation ratio for \vdkr and \edkr (of $r/2 + \varepsilon$, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:krpacking_intro}) in the setting of an arbitrary fixed maximum degree.

% The second direction is to consider other problems involving clique packing. For example, Chataigner et al.~\cite{CHATAIGNER20091396} study the approximability of the $\mathcal{K}_r$-packing problem, in which the goal is to find a vertex-disjoint set of cliques, each with size \emph{at most} $r$, that covers the maximum number of edges in the input graph.
